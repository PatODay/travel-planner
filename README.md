Travel Planner Built in Python

This planner does not scrape any data for actual cost of travel, instead it has pre-defined cities and cost to get there. The cities and subsequent costs are:

"Charlotte": 183
"Tampa": 220
"Pittsburgh": 222
"Los Angeles": 475

To run the script clone or download this repo and in the terminal type `python travel-planner-app.py`
